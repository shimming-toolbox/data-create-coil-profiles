# data-create-coil-profiles

This dataset contains acquisitions of a phantom to create custom coil profiles.
The coil has 8 channels. Field maps were acquired at 2 different currents
(-0.5A and +0.5A) for each channel. This data is taken from acdc60p. See this
[tutorial](https://shimming-toolbox.org/en/latest/user_section/tutorials/create_b0_coil_profiles.html) for more details.
